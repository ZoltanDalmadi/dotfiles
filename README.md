MY DOTFILES
===========

Repository of my dotfiles. Should be compatible with most distros, although they are optimized for Arch based ones.

Included:
- vim/gvim config
- tmux config
- bash config
- git config
- Music Player Daemon (mpd) config
- i3 window manager settings (with conky as statusbar)
- urxvt setting with color theme matching i3's color theme
- and many more...
